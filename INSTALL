INSTALL
-------

This is a short description of how to get oraload up and running. 
Since I have made no release yet, please do not expect too much.

Prerequisites:

You need a working Oracle-Install, i.e

- Oracle Server 
- Oracle Client (you may compile the sources, of course you need a server somewhere to get it to work)
- Oracle XE

You need cmake for the build process. Try "apt-cache search cmake" and then install from your Debian-Repositories. 
(Other OS I do not know yet)

The build-process:
CD to the source directory and type 

cmake .
make all
make install (as root). 

That's all.

Test it :
Type "oraload", this will give you a short description of command-line options.
