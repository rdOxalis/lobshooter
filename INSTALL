INSTALL
-------

This is a short description of how to get oraload up and running. 

 * Prerequisites:
 * 
 * You need a working Oracle-Install, i.e
 *
 * - Oracle Server 
 * - Oracle Client (you may compile the sources, of course you need a server somewhere to get it to work)
 * - Oracle XE
 * - Oracle Instant Client
 *
 * You need cmake for the build process. Try "apt-cache search cmake" and then install from your Debian-Repositories 
 * or get it from cmake.org
 * 
 * Set your Oracle Home Environment variable 
 * 
 * - for a standard xe install this would be /usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/server
 * - for an InstantClient install this would be sth like /path/to/InstantClient_top_level_dir
 *
 * The build-process:
 * - CD to the source directory and type 
 * - cmake .  (that is a dot here)
 * - make all
 * - make install (as root). 
 *
 * On runtime, set your library path like this:
 * 
 * - LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ORACLE_HOME/lib:$ORACLE_HOME/ctx/lib
 * - LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib
 * - export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 * 

That's all.

Test it :
Type "oraload -h", this will give you a short description of command-line options.
